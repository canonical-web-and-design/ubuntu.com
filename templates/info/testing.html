        <p>In addition to our six-monthly stable releases and our daily development  builds, we also make regular testing releases during the development  cycle. With just a few spare minutes, you can provide valuable feedback  on a test release and help polish and stabilise. Please see the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing">testing wiki page</a> for more  information on how to test and report back. Links to the test release downloads can be found on the pages listed below.</p>
        <p>Please test the latest available edition. Thank you!</p>
