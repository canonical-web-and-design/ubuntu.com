	<h2>Ubuntu is everywhere</h2>  
	<div class="seven-col">
		<p>Ubuntu&rsquo;s distinctive family of interfaces provide a great touch experience on the phone and the tablet, a great lean-back experience on the TV and, of course, a great desktop experience on the PC. Thanks to Canonical&rsquo;s hardware enablement partnerships, Ubuntu is now pre-installed on laptops and desktops from the world&rsquo;s top brands in all major global markets &ndash; in fact, our OEM partners predict that 10% of the world&rsquo;s new branded PCs will ship with Ubuntu in 2014.</p>
		<p>If you have your own UI, then you can build your own devices using the industry-standard Ubuntu Core, without the Ubuntu UI, and enjoy the most popular Linux toolchain, core system libraries, security updates and huge selection of packages at a very low cost per device. Whatever the architecture, Ubuntu is the fastest route to market.</p>
