		<p>As Ubuntu use grows, the world needs ever more phones, tablets, PCs, servers and clouds that are certified for compatibility. The opportunity for partners is immense.</p> 
	                 
		<p>To get to market quicker and reduce costs, OEMs and their partners need components that are compatible with the latest Ubuntu releases. For IHVs and ISVs, the big question is how to develop, test and certify such products.</p>
	                 
		<p>The answer is to work with Canonical, the company sponsoring the Ubuntu project. OEMs, IHVs, ISVs and peripheral manufacturers can subscribe to the Canonical Technical Partner Programme, which provides all the information, tools and training a manufacturer needs to keep its products ahead of the Ubuntu development curve.</p>
