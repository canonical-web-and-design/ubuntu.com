		<h1>China&rsquo;s own Ubuntu</h1>
		<p>Ubuntu Kylin is a free PC operating system created for China. It includes all the features you&rsquo;ve come to expect from Ubuntu, alongside essential Chinese software and apps. Unlike its rivals, its interface has been designed specifically to put Chinese users first &mdash; and with new support for touch screens and HiDPI monitors, it runs beautifully on all kinds of hardware.</p>
		<p>Part of the Ubuntu project since early 2013, the latest version of Ubuntu Kylin promises five years’ worth of support, keeping your computer running safely and smoothly for years to come.</p>

	<h2>A global partnership</h2>
	<p class="six-col">To create Ubuntu Kylin, Canonical partnered with China Software and Integrated Chip Promotions Centre (CSIP) and the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT) to produce a fully localised and customised version of Ubuntu.</p>
	<p class="six-col last-col">The team is working together with the open-source community to adapt the core features of Ubuntu to better suit Chinese users. Along with localised versions of the Ubuntu Software Centre, Ubuntu Kylin also features some of the most commonly used Chinese applications.</p>
