			<h3>By developers, for developers</h3>
			<p>Ubuntu is the result of contributions by thousands of developers, motivated by the desire to create their own perfect developer environment. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s used by some of the world&rsquo;s most exciting technology companies and it&rsquo;s why Valve decided to port its hugely popular Steam virtual games store to Ubuntu. Ubuntu runs on architectures from x86 to ARM and on cloud platforms from OpenStack to Azure and EC2. This versatility makes it the ideal choice for companies with a diverse hardware infrastructure.</p>

			<p>When it comes to speed and simplicity of deployment, nothing touches Ubuntu.</p>
			<p>Taking a service developed on the desktop and running it on a server or in the cloud just works.  Ubuntu also has developed Juju, a service orchestration tool, that simplifies the often-cumbersome handover between development and ops teams &mdash; and it speeds the process up dramatically.</p>
