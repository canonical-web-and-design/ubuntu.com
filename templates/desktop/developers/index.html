		<h3>By developers, for developers</h3>
		<p>Ubuntu is the result of contributions by thousands of developers, motivated by the desire to create their own perfect developer environment. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s used by some of the world&rsquo;s most exciting technology companies, like Instagram and Twitpic. And it&rsquo;s why Valve has decided to port its hugely popular Steam virtual games store to Ubuntu. Ubuntu&rsquo;s ability to run on any computing architecture and hardware platform makes it the ideal choice for companies with a &ldquo;bring your own device&rdquo; (BYOD) environment, or a diverse hardware infrastructure.</p>
