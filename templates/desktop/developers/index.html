		<h3>By developers, for developers</h3>
		<p>Ubuntu is the result of contributions by thousands of developers, motivated by the desire to create their own perfect developer environment. That’s why it&rsquo;s used by some of the world&rsquo;s most exciting technology companies, such as Instagram and Twitpic. And it&rsquo;s why Valve has decided to port its hugely popular Steam virtual games store to Ubuntu. Ubuntu runs on architectures from x86 to ARM and on cloud platforms from OpenStack to Azure and EC2. This versatility makes it the ideal choice for companies with a diverse hardware infrastructure, a &ldquo;bring your own device&rdquo; (BYOD) environment or plans to move operations to the cloud.</p>

		<h3>Deployment made easy</h3>
		<p>When it comes to speed and simplicity of deployment, nothing touches Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>Juju, Ubuntu’s service orchestration tool, simplifies the often-cumbersome handover between development and ops teams – and it speeds the process up dramatically. Juju Charms automate the deployment of common cloud services and enterprise applications, so your deployments can grow and shrink on demand. With hundreds of pre-existing Charms to adapt and the facility for developers to write their own, nothing gets new code into production as quickly and reliably as Juju.</p>
