		<p>Type any query into the Dash home and the Smart Scopes server will determine which categories of content are the most relevant to your search, returning only the best results.

	<h2>First look: Unity 8</h2>
	<div class="seven-col">
		<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the future of computing and you want to see how Ubuntu will look further down the line, you can download a preview version of Unity 8, Ubuntu&rsquo;s next-generation user interface. Designed to support a single user experience across the smartphone, the tablet and the PC, it uses the current version of Mir, the cross-platform display server being developed by the Ubuntu community. Do note, however, that Mir only works with open-source graphics drivers at present.</p>
		<p>To download the preview of Unity 8, search for unity8-desktop-session-mir in the Ubuntu Software Centre.</p>
