		<h1>Business as usual</h1>
		<p class="intro">Robust, beautiful and future-proof: There has never been a better time to use Ubuntu</p>
		<p>Why spend money on licenses, when Ubuntu offers a lightweight, secure and intuitive operating system for free? With Ubuntu, it’s business as usual. Its ease of use means users can get up and running immediately. It comes with a full office suite which supports Windows file formats. Or you can continue using Microsoft Office hosted on Windows or Citrix servers. With support for Windows XP having ended in April 2014, now is the perfect time to explore Ubuntu.</p>
