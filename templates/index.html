{#
  TAKEOVER INSTRUCTIONS

  - A takeover can belong to all, one or more than one language group.
    You can build a queue of them to rotate based on the user's language
    settings. For ones that should appear for all languages, use
    data-lang="all".  For example data-lang="de" will be for german only,
    while data-lang="en,de" will be for english and german.
  - Additionally, you should add a lang tag (eg lang="en" or lang="de")
    for the takeovers to allow for automatic translation

    EXAMPLE SECTION TAG

      section lang="en" data-lang="all" class="p-strip is-deep p-takeover--robotics js-takeover {% if not default %}u-hide{% endif %}" {% if default %}data-default="true"{% endif %}

  - Also, add a 'with default=True' below for one takeover to be the default
