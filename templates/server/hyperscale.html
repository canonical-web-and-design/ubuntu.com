		<h2>Welcome to hyperscale, the future of the datacentre</h2>
		<p>Computing in the 21st century will be done at an unprecedented scale, connecting people across the continents to a vast network of business, social and entertainment services.</p>
		<p>Providing compute capacity at that magnitude is today&rsquo;s top infrastructure challenge. That challenge is being taken on by a new wave of ultra-dense hardware, combined with software designed to natively scale out.</p>
		<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s servers will be built upon multiple architectures, including Intel x86 and ARM, and will be connected into datacentre-wide clusters via flexible, high-speed fabrics. At the heart of these clusters lies Ubuntu Server, the OS leading the cloud computing revolution.</p>

	<h2>Ubuntu Server for hyperscale</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>Ubuntu Server embraces the scale-out philosophy and comes out of the box with tools that make deploying a complex network of services as easy as drawing up a diagram and pressing &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</p>

	<div class="six-col last-col">
		<p>Ubuntu works seamlessly across x86 and ARM. And it comes with all the leading open source and commercial workloads built in, including Apache Hadoop, Inktank Ceph, 10gen MongoDB and many others.</p>

		<ul class="six-col list-canonical">
			<li><strong>Scale-out at the core</strong>: Ubuntu Server supports the scale-out compute model and provides tools which make it simple to manage the entire cluster.</li>
			<li><strong>No end-user license fee</strong>: Ubuntu is offered free to end-users. Adding 100 more nodes shouldn&rsquo;t require you to pay another 100 times for the OS!</li>

		<h2>Canonical&rsquo;s long-term commitment</h2>
		<p>Canonical&rsquo;s first investment in hyperscale dates back to 2008. We invested early in at scale management tools like Landscape and Juju, supporting the management of machines and services at scale through enterprise-class automation.</p>
		<p>Canonical is also a pioneer with ARM Servers, building the first commercial general-purpose ARM Linux OS in 2007 and the first ARM-based Server OS in 2009. We founded Linaro along with ARM in 2010.</p>
		<p>Ubuntu now runs on every significant ARM platform deployed in the datacentre, including the recently-announced Baidu storage cluster.</p>

		<h3>Workload-level orchestration with Juju</h3>
		<p>Canonical&rsquo;s Juju framework goes beyond traditional orchestration systems to create a new paradigm in workload deployment.</p>
		<p>Juju decouples services deployed onto the cluster from the nodes running them, and makes the deployment of the individual service easy.</p>
		<p>Juju also supports deployment to cloud services like Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud, and includes charms for open source workloads and key server ISV products.</p>

		<p>With their unique architecture, hyperscale servers need to be provisioned through scalable automation. Canonicalâ€™s <strong>Metal As A Service (MAAS)</strong> addresses the problem of deploying hundreds of OS instances to a cluster of nodes:</p>
		<p>MAAS provides a flexible mechanism to automatically detect, provision and configure individual nodes with Ubuntu server without any complex or manual configuration </p>
