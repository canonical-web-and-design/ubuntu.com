{% block meta_description %}Ubuntu comes to the phone and tablet with a ready-made app ecosystem. Thanks to its web APIs, any web property can be installed as an app for mobile devices, with its own icon and access to system services so that  to the user it appears just like a native app. Any HTML5 app can be easily ported, while native apps that use the full power of the hardware can be developed using the Ubuntu SDK. {% endblock %}

	<h1>A fast-evolving <br />app ecosystem</h1>
	<div class="four-col">
		<p>Already a very popular platform for web, Blackberry and Android mobile development, you&rsquo;ll want to bring all your apps to Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>A great app will use the unique features in Ubuntu to create a fresh, uncluttered, purposeful and fast experience. Make one app binary for all form factors &ndash; web or native. You have it all at your fingertips when you run Ubuntu on <br />your workstation.</p>

	<h2>We love the web</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>Web apps are first class citizens on Ubuntu, with APIs that provide deep integration into the system. HTML5 apps written for other platforms can be adapted to Ubuntu with ease, and we&rsquo;re targeting standard cross-platform web app development frameworks like PhoneGap to make Ubuntu “Just Work” for those apps.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="six-col last-col">
		<p>Our unique web app system lets you adapt any web property for installation as an app on Ubuntu, running independently <br />of the browser, with its own icon and access to system services. Which means that all the big names will be available to Ubuntu phone and tablet users at launch.</p>

		<h2>We also go native</h2>
		<p>For rich applications with gorgeous movement and transitions and graphics-heavy games, Ubuntu provides <br />an amazing native developer toolset. QML provides a slick, easy development environment for native apps with engines in C or C++ and JavaScript for UI glue where performance isn&rsquo;t critical. We also give you full native OpenGL, which the top games companies are using to make incredible games. That&rsquo;s why big name developers like EA, Valve Software and Unity Technologies already target Ubuntu.</p>

		<h2>One app on Ubuntu for all <br/>form factors</h2>
		<p>Perhaps the most exciting thing about writing native apps for Ubuntu <br />is the opportunity to write and build a single app with responsive interfaces that allow it to run on any Ubuntu device. In other words, <br />you can use the Ubuntu SDK to build your app and, with some care and attention, make it available to users of Ubuntu PCs, phones and tablets &ndash; all in a single upload to the Ubuntu Software Centre.</p>

		<h2>Our cloud is your cloud</h2>
		<p>The Ubuntu One personal cloud service provides every Ubuntu user with free storage space and the option to buy more. But for developers, Ubuntu One offers much more. The U1DB cloud-syncing database provides APIs to sync any kind of data to the cloud &ndash; not just files.</p>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re a mobile operator and want a fast way to develop cloud-based services for your users, Ubuntu One enables you <br />to develop integrated, differentiating services, without the need to maintain your own infrastructure &ndash; manage identity, payments and service activation securely.</p>
