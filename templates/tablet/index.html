		<h2>Effortless navigation with magic edges</h2>
		<p>Use all four edges of the screen to navigate between apps, settings and controls. There are no buttons on the Ubuntu tablet, you don&rsquo;t have to keep returning to <br />the home screen every time you want to switch apps &ndash; everything is available at <br />a swipe. Leaner, cleaner, more elegant hardware designs are possible with Ubuntu &ndash; the result is a joy to use.</p>

		<p>Ubuntu feels cleaner, more spacious and less cluttered because we don&rsquo;t need buttons on every screen &ndash; your content is king. Swiping up from the bottom edge reveals app controls. <br />Don&rsquo;t swipe, you don&rsquo;t see any buttons or toolbars.

		<h2>A gorgeous gallery <br/>for your digital life</h2>
		<p>The Gallery app is a stylish native Ubuntu application that <br />lets you organise and share photos. It&rsquo;s a great example of convergent app design and engineering: one app works on phone, tablet and desktop and it&rsquo;s equally beautiful and usable in every environment.</p>
		<p>On the phone, you can browse photos, and on the tablet, <br />you can create albums &ndash; Ubuntu will organise your pictures into events by date or you can create custom collections.</p>
		<p>Your photos are all instantly uploaded to your personal <br />cloud and available on all your devices &ndash; including those <br/>running iOS, Android and Windows. <br/>Share them with one touch.</p>

		<p>Facebook and Twitter aren&rsquo;t the only ways to share. <br />Ubuntu One already has millions of users on Ubuntu, Android, Windows and Mac. Deeply integrated on Ubuntu devices, it provides free storage, paid-for music streaming services and <br />a foundation for cloud-based services from operators and device makers.</p>

		<h2>A whole world of apps</h2>
		<p>Web applications sit alongside native apps as equal citizens <br />on Ubuntu &ndash; with their own icons and access to system services. Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, Gmail and Spotify are all available from day one &ndash; thanks to Ubuntu&rsquo;s brilliant web app system, developers can easily make their site install on the tablet as an app.</p>
		<p>We aren&rsquo;t limited to HTML5. Native apps are blazingly fast, taking advantage of the full capabilities of the tablet&rsquo;s processor and graphics hardware. A mobile SDK does most <br />of the work for you, giving you that Ubuntu style. It&rsquo;s easy for Android and Blackberry developers to publish for the Ubuntu audience too, and since you&rsquo;re already running Ubuntu on your development workstations, everything you need is at your fingertips.</p>

		<h2>Convergence that just clicks</h2>
		<p>Today&rsquo;s tablets are as powerful as ultra-light laptops. Ubuntu uniquely supports a new category of convergence device &ndash; add a keyboard and mouse and your Ubuntu tablet becomes <br />a full PC and thin client, with access to Windows apps over standard protocols from Microsoft, Citrix, VMware and Wyse. That lets enterprise IT deploy a single, secure, portable corporate device for all kinds of applications.</p>
		<p>Since it is pure Ubuntu, the tablet can be managed via Landscape, giving enterprises complete control over the users, apps, updated and access using the same tool they <br />use for Ubuntu servers and desktops today.</p>
