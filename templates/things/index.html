            <p>Critical infrastructure systems are an attack vector for espionage and disruption. Ubuntu Core devices are automatically updated to address systemic vulnerabilities - fast. Ubuntu Core also provides best-in-class application isolation based on kernel containers, minimising the impact of errors and vulnerabilities in third-party applications.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Certified and supported Ubuntu Core platforms set the new standard for safety and security in connected devices&#8221; said Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical and Ubuntu. &#8220;Device manufacturers who choose Ubuntu Core on certified platforms now have a popular platform that meets corporate and government requirements for security updates and management.&#8221;</p>

        <h2>Widest range of supported devices</h2>
        <p>Both ARMv7 and X86-64 are supported. Using standard PC equipment makes device prototyping easy. &#8220;A spare laptop or PC becomes your initial development board,&#8221; explains Alexander Sack. &#8220;Turn an old PC into a home storage server or prototype your robot app on a spare laptop or virtual machine.&#8221;</p>
        <h3>From low-cost consumer developer boards&#8230;</h3>
        <p>From the $35 ARMv7 Odroid-C1, which offers 1 GB RAM along with gigabit networking and a wide range of RaspberryPi-style expansion ports and pins, to the $179 2 Ghz Octacore Odroid-XU3 with 2 GB RAM and loads of display and I/O, Ubuntu works across the widest range of ARM developer boards, helping you develop your application secure in the knowledge that you can select the right silicon close the point of manufacture. Reducing the time between innovation and sales is a key advantage for Ubuntu based devices.</p>
        <p>Ubuntu Core requires a 600 mhz processor with 128 MB RAM. Devices require 4GB flash for factory reset and system rollback. Ubuntu Core itself uses 40MB RAM leaving the rest for applications. The <a href="http://beagleboard.org/black-snappy" class="external">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433" class="external">Odroid-C1</a>, and <a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/02/02/snappy-ubuntu-core-on-raspberry-pi-2/" class="external">Raspberry Pi 2</a> are recommended ARM development boards.
