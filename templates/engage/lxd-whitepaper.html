        LXD, the system container manager, developed by Canonical and shipped by default with Ubuntu, makes it possible to create many containers of various Linux distributions and manage them in a way similar to virtual machines (VMs) but with lower overhead costs associated with them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike VMs, containers have the benefit of using a shared kernel such as; kernel security updates in Ubuntu, Livepatch support, minimal memory footprint, ease of sharing resources and an extremely low CPU usage/wakeups at idle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This whitepaper explores the use of LXD containers as part of a team development environment, effectively setting up a shared lab on physical hardware or in the cloud.

          Reduces the time spent by team members getting a functional work environment

        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">
          Makes it easy to collaborate with colleagues, accessing their containers if needed
        </li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">
          Makes it possible to access the work environment of team members who are on leave
        </li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">
          Better use and control of resources by using shared systems
        </li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">
          Easy to implement snapshots and backups, huge time savers when a mistake happens
