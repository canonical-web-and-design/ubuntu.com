      <p>The Linux distribution model, whilst established and well understood for computing, has some limitations when it comes to IoT edge gateway devices.</p>
      <p>Due to often being located in remote or hard to access areas, there is a greater demand for a system that offers both high levels of robustness and security. Therefore, having a standard Linux distribution as the base is often not the optimal choice.</p>
      <p>The use of generalist Linux distributions will likely lead to problems and greater complexity, putting the success of these projects at risk.</p>
      <p>This problem can be solved with a combination of Ubuntu Core, snaps and Kura.</p>
