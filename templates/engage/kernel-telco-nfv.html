      <h3>About the whitepaper</h3>
        <p>Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) has taken root in the production environments of telecoms operators. The individual components of NFV, known as Virtualised Networks Functions (VNFs), are critically tied to a general purpose operating system, as opposed to being integrated into application-specific devices.</p>

        <p>This union makes performance and support of core operating system components, like the kernel, the foundational metrics of success. This special report will demonstrate that Ubuntu 18.04 LTS offers the necessary, proven reliability, while also offering supported kernel choices that enhance the efficiency of VNF operations and functions.
        </p>
