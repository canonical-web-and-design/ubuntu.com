        For organisations looking to turn the management of bare-metal server resources into a cloud-like environment, hardware testing is a must-do.  
        Not only does it lead to optimal hardware utilisation, it also reduces the cost of operations and increases developer productivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimised testing also eases the hardware validation process by providing a framework that allows large-scale, automated testing of hardware with minimum effort to ensure that the physical infrastructure is ready to serve production workloads. Welcome to metal-as-a-service (MAAS).
