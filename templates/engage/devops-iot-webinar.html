        Traditional development methods do not scale into the IoT sphere. Strong inter-dependencies and blurred boundaries among components in the edge device stack result in fragmentation, slow updates, security issues, increased cost, and reduced reliability of platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reality places a major strain on IoT players who need to contend with varying cycles and priorities in the development stack, limiting their flexibility to innovate and introduce changes into their products, both on the hardware and software sides. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One notable way to reduce the complexity in multi-component stacks is through the use of DevOps - a paradigm that combines development with operations in a single and streamlined process. However, DevOps alone cannot solve the complexity and dependency that exists in monolithic IoT products.
