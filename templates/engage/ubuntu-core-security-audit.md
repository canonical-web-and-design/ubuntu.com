Manufacturers of Internet of Things (IoT) devices require an embedded operating system that is feature-rich, scalable, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; secure. Built from the ground-up to meet these requirements, Ubuntu Core represents a comprehensive ecosystem for large-scale IoT deployments that solves many of the security challenges associated with traditional Linux distribution models &mdash; while also empowering developers with unprecedented flexibility and control.

This whitepaper from global cybersecurity experts, Rule4, provides an independent, third-party evaluation of Ubuntu Core’s security capabilities. Following a data-driven approach, all aspects received extensive testing to validate the strengths of its cybersecurity controls.

Read the report to learn about:
