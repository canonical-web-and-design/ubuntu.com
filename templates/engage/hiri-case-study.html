        There’s a widespread assumption that Linux users are only interested in
        free, open source software and won’t pay for proprietary solutions.
        Hiri, the business focused email client, demonstrated that assumption
        isn’t necessarily accurate when they launched their snap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Available for Microsoft and Mac users, Hiri was keen to extend their
        support to Linux users but initial feedback suggested they would be met
        with resistance. In addition, previous attempts to launch Hiri for the
        Linux market had led to significant maintenance requirements due to the
        different configurations users installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read the case study to learn about the journey Hiri took from the early
        resistance to publishing a snap which now means 25% of their revenues
        are generated from Linux users.
      </p>
