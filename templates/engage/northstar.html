      <p>Although critical, there are some tasks that are too hazardous for human workers to carry out such as clearing snow from busy airport runways in winter. Added to this, finding skilled workers to operate the heavy machinery needed to perform these jobs is increasingly difficult in a market reportedly in short supply.</p>
      <p>Northstar Robotics, a Canadian tech start-up founded in 2016, wants to address these challenges by developing autonomous vehicles and wanted to find out if an entire fleet of vehicles can be powered by a single intelligent control system.</p>
