Few enterprises want all their computing devices to be fully exposed to the internet. In an environment of ever-growing security threats, isolating internal networks from the wider internet is not simply best practice, but borderline essential.

However, with all the benefits that restricted networks provide, it can pose challenges for enterprises who are looking to take advantage of certain technologies. One of these is the automatic update feature of snaps which enable a low-friction process and a fast release cadence. If an enterprise has a restricted network, then this will prevent snaps being able to automatically update due to the necessity for an external internet connection and potentially upsetting change management policies.

The Snap Store Proxy overcomes these issues and enables enterprises to take full advantage of snaps while maintaining the governance and security control that they require.

In this whitepaper, you will learn:
