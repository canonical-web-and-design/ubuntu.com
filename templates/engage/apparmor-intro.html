      <p>Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, attack frequency is on the rise, and the cost of cybercrime damage is projected to reach <a class="p-link--external" href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/top-5-cybersecurity-facts-figures-predictions-and-statistics-for-2019-to-2021/">$6 trillion annually by 2021</a>. Traditional defensive measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems that operate at the network perimeter are no longer enough to protect today&#39;s distributed enterprise networks. Rather, a &#39;defence in depth&#39; approach is required in order to protect all facets of an organisation&#39;s digital infrastructure.</p>

      <p>In an ideal world, applications would be free from security vulnerabilities but, once compromised, even a trusted application can become untrustworthy. AppArmor provides a crucial layer of security around applications. By providing the capability to whitelist an application&#39;s permissible actions, AppArmor enables administrators to apply the principle of least privilege to applications. Once in place, AppArmor can halt attacks and minimise or prevent damage in the event of a breach.</p>

      <p>This whitepaper provides a technical introduction to AppArmor, including:</p>
