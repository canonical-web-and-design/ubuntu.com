		<h1>Commercial info</h1>
		<h2>Terms</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu is a free and open source platform. Commercial engagements between Canonical and partners shipping Ubuntu products cover trademarks, legal assurance, engineering engagements, certification, update management, online services. In addition, third-party components for media in particular are often encumbered by patent and licensing restrictions.</p>
		<p>Companies wishing to distribute an Ubuntu-branded commercial device pay a per unit service fee covering the engineering, maintenance, quality assurance, third-party licensing fees and Canonical consulting costs. Engagements are structured with some NRE, baseline volume commitments, and volume-based pricing for service fees.</p>
		<p>Canonical shares post-purchase services revenue from the sale of content, applications and subscriptions through Ubuntu TV products with OEM&rsquo;s and distribution / channel partners.</p>

		<h2>Maintenance</h2>
		<p>Modern connected device strategies emphasise the ability to update and upgrade software in-place, often automatically.

		<p>The ability to update your devices is central to your security and long-term competitiveness. Canonical takes care of all security and critical bug fixes to the base platform offering and provides the infrastructure to support your update management strategy.
