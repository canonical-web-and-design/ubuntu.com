	<h1>Contributing to Ubuntu TV</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to Ubuntu, where you can shape the future to suit yourself.</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu TV is an open-source project that enjoys the commercial support of Canonical. It has the depth and strength that come from having thousands of contributors from every walk of life and every conceivable professional discipline, working together to make something for themselves, and everyone else. And it gets stronger when more people contribute.</p>

		<h2>The Ubuntu Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>The quality of our work is a product of the quality of our discussions. We promote debate and participation, and we ensure that conversations stay productive, positive and constructive. <a href="/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">Our Code of Conduct</a> sets the tone for all Ubuntu work, including this TV initiative. It lays out the expectations that we have of those who participate, represent or engage with the project.</p>
		<p>Essentially, it calls on people to treat one another with respect, regardless of their differences of opinion, and it is the foundation for all of our governance practices.</p>

		<h2>Licensing for Ubuntu TV</h2>

		<ul class="list-bullets">
			<li>libdeclarative-multimedia from Qt Mobility</li>
			<li>libqt4-declarative-shaders from Qt</li>
			<li>GStreamer</li>

	<h2>What about MythTV and XBMC?</h2>
	<div class="seven-col no-border">
		<p>Myth TV and XBMC are popular open-source TV projects, particularly in the Ubuntu community. We&rsquo;re very pleased to collaborate with members of both communities, enhancing the quality of back-end code that is shared between projects.</p>
		<p>Our focus is to bring a Unity front end to the TV, suitably adapted to the entertainment, lean-back experience of the living room, but there are plenty of areas where our needs intersect perfectly with those of other communities.</p>
		<p>Any improvements or changes we make to either project are contributed back. And we welcome contributions from both communities.</p>
