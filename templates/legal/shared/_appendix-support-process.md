<h1 id="appendix-support-process">Appendix {{number}} - Support Process</h1>

1.  <h2 id="appendix-support-process-service-initiation">Service initiation</h2>

    1.  Upon commencement of the services, Canonical will provide access for a single technical representative to Landscape, the support portal and the online knowledge base.
    2.  The customer - through their initial technical representative - may select their chosen technical representatives to interface with Canonical based on the number of systems under support as represented in the table below. These technical representatives will hold credentials to the support portal and will act as primary points of contact for support requests.

    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">Table of machines under support</p>

    |Number of machines under Ubuntu Advantage support|Technical representatives|
    |----|----|
    |1-20|2|
    |21-50|3|
    |51-250|6|
    |251-1000|9|
    |1001-5000|12|
    |5001+|15|

    4.  The customer may change their specified technical representatives at any time by submitting a support request via the support portal.

2.  <h2 id="appendix-support-process-submitting-support-requests">Submitting support requests</h2>

    1.  The customer may open a support request once the customer account has been provisioned within the support portal.
    2.  The customer may submit support cases through the support portal or by contacting the support team by telephone, unless otherwise noted.
    3.  A support case should consist of a single discrete problem, issue, or request.
    4.  Cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence not entered directly into the case, including emails and telephone calls, will be logged into the case with a timestamp for quality assurance.
    5.  When reporting a case, the customer should provide an impact statement to help Canonical determine the appropriate severity level. Customers with multiple concurrent support cases may be asked to prioritize cases according to severity of business impact.
    6.  The customer is expected to provide all information requested by Canonical as we work to resolve the case.
    7.  Canonical will keep a record of each case within the support portal enabling the customer to track and respond to all current cases and allowing for review of historical cases.

3.  <h2 id="appendix-support-process-hotfixes">Hotfixes</h2>

    To temporarily resolve critical support cases, Canonical may provide a version of the affected software (e.g. package) that applies a patch. Such versions are referred to as “hotfixes”. Hotfixes provided by Canonical are valid until 90 days after the corresponding patch has been incorporated into a release of the software in the Ubuntu Archives. However, if a patch is rejected by the applicable upstream project, the hotfix will no longer be supported and the case will remain open.

4.  <h2 id="appendix-support-process-languages">Languages</h2>

    Canonical will provide support in English. Other languages may be available at certain times.

5.  <h2 id="appendix-support-process-remote-sessions">Remote sessions</h2>

    Canonical may offer to access the customer's supported system using a remote access service. In such case, Canonical will determine which remote access service to use.
