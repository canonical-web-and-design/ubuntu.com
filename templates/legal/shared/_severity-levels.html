    <li class="p-list__item">Once a support request is opened, a Canonical Support Engineer will validate the case information and determine the severity level, working with the customer to assess the urgency of the case.</li>
    <li class="p-list__item">Response times will be as set forth in the Service Description for the applicable service offering.</li>
    <li class="p-list__item">When setting the severity level, Canonical's Support Team will use the definitions as stated below:</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Severity Level 1 &mdash; Core functionality not available</h4>
  <p>
    Canonical will use continuous effort according to the service level purchased, through appropriate support engineer(s) and/or development engineer(s), to provide a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level.
  </p>

  <h4>Severity Level 2 &mdash; Core functionality severely degraded</h4>
  <p>
    Canonical will provide concerted efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is no longer severely degraded, the severity level will be lowered to level 3.
  </p>

  <h4>Severity Level 3 &mdash; Standard support request</h4>
  <p>
    Canonical will use reasonable efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a work-around is provided, Canonical&#39;s support engineers will continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.
  </p>

  <h4>Severity Level 4 &mdash; Non-urgent request</h4>
  <p>
    Level 4 requests include cosmetic issues, informational requests, feature requests, and similar matters. Canonical does not provide a timeline or guarantee for inclusion of any feature requests. Canonical will review each level 4 case and determine whether it is a product enhancement to be considered for a future release, an issue to be fixed in the current release or an issue to be fixed in a future release. Canonical will review and respond to information requests with a reasonable level of effort during coverage hours. Canonical may close cases representing level 4 issues after responding if Canonical believes it is appropriate to do so.
