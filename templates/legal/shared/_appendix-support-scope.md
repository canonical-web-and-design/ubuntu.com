<h1 id="appendix-support-scope">Appendix {{number}} - Support scope</h1>

<h2 id="appendix-support-scope-openstack">Ubuntu Advantage OpenStack</h2>

Definitions:

- "OpenStack" means the cloud computing software known as "OpenStack" as distributed by Canonical with Ubuntu.
- "OpenStack Packages" means packages relative to OpenStack present in the Ubuntu Main repository of the Ubuntu Archive, including updates to those packages delivered in the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. This includes Charms listed at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/OpenStackCharms](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/OpenStackCharms)
- "Region" means a discrete OpenStack environment with dedicated API endpoints that typically shares only the Identity (Keystone) service with other Regions. An OpenStack Region must be contained within a single datacenter.
- "Public Cloud" means a cloud environment in which third parties are able to create and manage guest instances.
- "Cloud Guest" means an instance of Ubuntu Server not running in a Public Cloud.
- "Full Stack Support" means addressing problems pertaining to user and operations-level OpenStack functionality, performance and availability.
- "Bug-fix Support" means support for valid code bugs in OpenStack Packages only. This does not include troubleshooting of issues to determine if a bug is present.
- "Valid Customizations" means configurations made through Horizon or the OpenStack API of the OpenStack Packages. For the avoidance of doubt, valid customizations do not include architectural changes that are not expressly executed or authorized by Canonical. Configuration options set during a Foundation OpenStack Build should be considered critical to the health of the Cloud. Any changes to these may render the cloud unsupported. Request for changes should be validated by Canonical to ensure continued support.

Supported versions of OpenStack:

- The version of OpenStack provided initially in the release of a Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu is supported for the entire lifecycle of that Ubuntu version.
- Releases of OpenStack released after an LTS version of Ubuntu are available in the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. Each OpenStack release in the Ubuntu Cloud Archive is supported on an Ubuntu LTS version for a minimum of 18 months from the release date of the Ubuntu version that included the applicable OpenStack version.
- The OpenStack release support schedule is available here [https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle](/about/release-cycle).

Support of OpenStack

- OpenStack support is provided at the Advanced response times.
- OpenStack support requires each Region to consist of 12 or more supported nodes. All nodes that participate in the OpenStack environment must be covered under an active support agreement.
- In addition to the hardware requirements laid out in [Section 2.2](#support-scope-hardware), hardware must meet the [minimum criteria for Ubuntu OpenStack.](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/193373c7-canonical-foundation-cloud-requirements-2018-07-18.pdf)
- Full Stack Support of an OpenStack Cloud is only available when deployed via a Foundation OpenStack Build engagement.
  - Canonical will provide support for the charms deployed via a Foundation OpenStack Build.
  - For any deployments done under contract with Canonical, which results in customization of any Charms, customization will be valid for 90 days after the official release of the Charm which includes the customizations.
  - Support is included for all packages required to run OpenStack as deployed via the Foundation OpenStack Build engagement.
  - Upgrades of OpenStack components as part of the regular Ubuntu LTS maintenance cycle are supported.
  - Upgrades between versions of OpenStack (for instance, from OpenStack Mitaka to Newton) or versions of Ubuntu (for instance, from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), Juju and MAAS are supported as long as the upgrade is performed following a documented process as specified by Canonical as part of the Foundation OpenStack Build.
  - Addition of new cloud nodes and replacement of existing nodes with new nodes of equivalent capacity are both supported.
  - Full Stack Support excludes customizations which are not considered Valid Customizations.
  - Ubuntu Advantage Virtual Guest Advanced and Ubuntu Advantage Kubernetes Advanced services for Cloud Guests.
- OpenStack clouds not deployed through a Foundation OpenStack Build are limited to Bug-fix Support.

OpenStack support does not include support beyond Bug-fix Support during the deployment or configuration of an OpenStack cloud.

Charms

- Each charm version is supported for one year from the release date.
- Canonical will not provide support for any charms that have been modified from the supported version found in in the page at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/OpenStackCharms](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/OpenStackCharms).

Support for 12 TB of usable storage per node with Ceph or Swift storage exposed to the OpenStack cluster. This allowance can be used for Ubuntu Advantage Ceph, Ubuntu Advantage Swift or a combination of these. The number of these nodes cannot exceed the number of compute nodes covered in the OpenStack cluster.

Licence to use available Canonical provided Microsoft-certified drivers in Windows Guest instances.

Service excludes:

- Support for workloads other than those required to run an OpenStack deployment.
- Support for guest instances other than Cloud Guests.
