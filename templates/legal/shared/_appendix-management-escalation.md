<h1 id="appendix-management-escalation">Appendix {{number}} - Management Escalation</h1>

In the event of an unsatisfactory service of any kind, there are several ways to escalate this situation to Canonical management.

## Feedback at end of case

When a case is closed, a survey will be emailed to the case owner concerning overall experience with Canonical's support. All surveys are reviewed by management.

## Ask for a Peer Review

As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback.

## Management escalation

Non-urgent needs

- Please request a management escalation within the case itself. A manager will be contacted to review the case and post a response within 1 business day.
