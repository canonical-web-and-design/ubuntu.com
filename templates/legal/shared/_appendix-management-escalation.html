      <p>In the event of an unsatisfactory service of any kind, there are several ways to escalate this situation to Canonical management.</p>

      <h2>Feedback at end of case</h2>
      <p>When a case is closed, a survey will be emailed to the case owner concerning overall experience with Canonical&#39;s support. All surveys are reviewed by management.</p>

      <h2>Ask for a Peer Review</h2>
      <p>As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback.</p>
