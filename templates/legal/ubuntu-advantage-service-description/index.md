   <h2 id="uasd-managed-services">Managed Services</h2>

   1. Overview. Managed Services are an add-on to Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure Advanced. When added on, Canonical will manage the [Environment](#environment) as described below, and Guests running in the environment receive the Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure subscriptions and support. When the Environment is a [Cloud](#cloud), the Managed Services are referred to as “BootStack”.
   2. Service initiation. Following Canonical’s building and initialising of the Environment (subject to separate service engagement), the Managed Service will re-deploy the Environment to reset credentials and validate the deployment process. The Managed Service will also provide documentation providing further detail on the working relationship with Canonical.
   3. Operate. The Managed Service will remotely operate, monitor, and manage the Environment. Examples include: (i) backing up and restoring of the management infrastructure suite, (ii) hardware and software failure monitoring and alerting, and (iii) capacity and performance reporting.
      1. Patching and updates. The Managed Service will install applicable (e.g. security) patches and updates from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive to:
         1. The Ubuntu operating system.
         2. [OpenStack](#OpenStack) or [Kubernetes](#Kubernetes) and its dependencies.
         3. OpenStack or Kubernetes Charms.
         4. Other software deployed as part of the Environment.
      1. Administrative access. The Managed Service will provide the customer with access to the following applications and/or services:

         2. Landscape (restricted to read only access).
         3. Monitoring and logging system (restricted to read only access).
         4. Only Canonical will have login access to Environment Nodes.
      1. Environment size. The Managed Service will add or remove Nodes from the Environment as requested by the customer through a support ticket, provided that the Environment does not go under the [Minimum Size Requirement](#Minimum-Size-Requirement). All Environment Nodes must be covered under the service, so additional fees may apply.
   Ubuntu, OpenStack and Kubernetes upgrades. The Managed Service will ensure the customer’s Environment remains on a supported version of Ubuntu and OpenStack and/or Kubernetes. In most cases, Canonical will upgrade only to LTS releases where applicable, or to a specific release as agreed with the customer.
   1. Out of scope. The Managed Service does not provide:
      1. Relating to [Guest Instance](#guest-instance)s or [Container Instances](#container-instance):
         1. Managing the operating system or applications running within Guest Instances or Container Instances.
         2. Monitoring of Guest Instances or Container Instances.
         3. Backup or recovery of customer generated data (e.g. any applications or databases running) within Guest Instances or Container Instances.
         4. Support for the ability to run Guest Instances using images other than those provided by Canonical.
      1. Architectural changes to the Environment.
      2. Alternative scheduling of updates or upgrades.
      3. Installation of packages or software other than those in the applicable Ubuntu Main Repository or updates to those packages delivered in the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.
      4. Supported version of Ubuntu, [OpenStack](#OpenStack) or [Kubernetes](#Kubernetes) must be within the 5 year ‘general’ release window.
   Installation of additional components (e.g. LBaaS, VPNaaS, SDN or SDS) beyond the software installed as part of the building of the Environment
   1. Service conclusion. At the end of the service term, the Managed Service will initiate an operational transfer. Operational transfer includes:
      1. hand over of all credentials of the hosts and management software to the customer.
      2. hand over of the administrative credentials of Landscape (The continued operation of Landscape is subject to purchase and agreement of appropriate license terms.)
      3. coordination of any applicable training (if purchased).
   1. Customer dependencies. The Managed Service requires:
      1. continuous VPN access for Canonical support personnel to the Environment;
      2. utilisation parameters per Node to be kept below the maximum specified in the design document provided by Canonical when the Environment is delivered to the customer;
      3. the facility where the Environment is hosted to comply with the minimum required measures to function, including but not limited to, connectivity, sufficient power supply, sufficient cooling system, and physical access control to the environment; and
      4. that the [Minimum Size Requirement](#Minimum-Size-Requirement) for the Cloud or [Cluster](#cluster) is maintained at all times.
   1. Uptime Service Level
      1. The Managed Service includes the following uptime service levels:<br />
  ||Data plane for customer workloads which are distributed across two regions|Data plane for customer workloads which are in a single region|Control plane (OpenStack/Kubernetes API, Web UI and CLI)|

      1. Data plane includes:
        1. Virtualisation (for workloads which are architected to not depend on a single compute node).
        2. Storage (Block & Object).
        3. Network for instances.
      1. Downtime must be directly attributable to Canonical in order for it to count against the service level and is measured across a 12 month period. Planned maintenance windows and any requests by the customer are not taken into account when calculating uptime.

<h2 id="uasd-ubuntu-advantage-support-services-process">Ubuntu Advantage Support Services Process</h2>

1. Service initiation
     1. Upon commencement of the services, Canonical will provide access for a single technical representative to Landscape, the support portal, and the online knowledge base.
     2. The customer, through their initial technical representative, may select their chosen technical representatives to interface with Canonical based on the number of systems under support as represented in the table below. These technical representatives will hold credentials to the support portal and will act as primary points of contact for support requests.
      |Number of machines under Ubuntu Advantage support|Technical representatives|
      |----|----|
      |1-20|2|
      |21-50|3|
      |51-250|6|
      |251-1000|9|
      |1001-5000|12|
      |5001+|15|
     3. The customer may change their specified technical representatives at any time by submitting a support request via the support portal.
2. Submitting support requests
     1. The customer may open a support request once the customer account has been provisioned within the support portal.
     2. The customer may submit support cases through the support portal or by contacting the support team by telephone, unless otherwise noted.
     3. A support case should consist of a single discrete problem, issue, or request.
     4. Cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence not entered directly into the case, including emails and telephone calls, will be logged into the case with a timestamp for quality assurance.
     5. When reporting a case, the customer should provide an impact statement to help Canonical determine the appropriate severity level. Customers with multiple concurrent support cases may be asked to prioritize cases according to severity of business impact.
     6. The customer is expected to provide all information requested by Canonical as we work to resolve the case.
     7. Canonical will keep a record of each case within the support portal enabling the customer to track and respond to all current cases and allowing for review of historical cases.
3. Support severity levels
     1. Once a support request is opened, a Canonical Support Engineer will validate the case information and determine the severity level, working with the customer to assess the urgency of the case.
     2. Response times will be as set forth in the Service Description for the applicable service offering.
     3. When setting the severity level, Canonical's Support Team will use the definitions as stated below:
     | | |
     |--|--|
     |**Severity Level 1**<br />Core functionality not available|Canonical will use continuous effort according to the service level purchased, through appropriate support engineer(s) and/or development engineer(s), to provide a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level.|
     |**Severity Level 2**<br />Core functionality severely degraded|Canonical will provide concerted efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is no longer severely degraded, the severity level will be lowered to level 3.|
     |**Severity Level 3**<br />Standard support request|Canonical will use reasonable efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a work-around is provided, Canonical's support engineers will continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.|
     |**Severity Level 4**<br />Non-urgent request|Level 4 requests include cosmetic issues, informational requests, feature requests, and similar matters. Canonical does not provide a timeline or guarantee for inclusion of any feature requests. Canonical will review each level 4 case and determine whether it is a product enhancement to be considered for a future release, an issue to be fixed in the current release or an issue to be fixed in a future release. Canonical will review and respond to information requests with a reasonable level of effort during coverage hours. Canonical may close cases representing level 4 issues after responding if Canonical believes it is appropriate to do so.|
4. Response times. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests made by the customer within the response times set forth below, based on the applicable service and severity level.
    1.  <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">Table of response times</p>
|    |Standard|Advanced|
|----|--------|--------|
|**Severity Level 1**|2 business hours|1 hour|
|**Severity Level 2**|4 business hours|4 business hours|
|**Severity Level 3**|10 business hours|6 business hours|
|**Severity Level 4**|20 business hours|10 business hours|
   	2. Resolution. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to resolve support cases, but Canonical does not guarantee a work-around, resolution or resolution time.
5. Hotfixes. To temporarily resolve critical support cases, Canonical may provide a version of the affected software (e.g. package) that applies a patch. Such versions are referred to as “hotfixes”. Hotfixes provided by Canonical are supported for 90 days after the corresponding patch has been incorporated into a release of the software in the Ubuntu Archives. However, if a patch is rejected by the applicable upstream project, the hotfix will no longer be supported and the case will remain open.
6. Languages. Canonical will provide support in English. Other languages may be available at certain times.
7. Remote sessions. Canonical may offer to access the customer’s supported system using a remote access service. In such case, Canonical will determine which remote access service to use.
8. Ubuntu Advantage Management Escalation. In the event of an unsatisfactory service of any kind, there are several ways to escalate this situation to Canonical management.
9. Feedback at end of case. When a case is closed, a survey will be emailed to the case owner concerning overall experience with Canonical’s support. All surveys are reviewed by management.
10. Ask for a Peer Review. As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback.
11. Management escalation. The customer may escalate support issues following the escalation process:
      1. Non-urgent needs. Request a management escalation within the case itself. A manager will be contacted to review the case and post a response within 1 business day.
      2. Urgent needs.
          1. Escalate to Canonical’s Support & Technical Services Manager by emailing support-manager@canonical.com.
          2. If you require further escalation, email Canonical’s Support & Technical Services Director at operations-director@canonical.com.
