  <br />
  3. The customer may change their specified technical representatives at any time by submitting a support request via the support portal.
2. Submitting support requests
  1. The customer may open a support request once the customer account has been provisioned within the support portal.
  2. The customer may submit support cases through the support portal or by contacting the support team by telephone, unless otherwise noted.
  3. A support case should consist of a single discrete problem, issue, or request.
  4. Cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence not entered directly into the case, including emails and telephone calls, will be logged into the case with a timestamp for quality assurance.
  5. When reporting a case, the customer should provide an impact statement to help Canonical determine the appropriate severity level. Customers with multiple concurrent support cases may be asked to prioritize cases according to severity of business impact.
  6. The customer is expected to provide all information requested by Canonical as we work to resolve the case.
  7. Canonical will keep a record of each case within the support portal enabling the customer to track and respond to all current cases and allowing for review of historical cases.
3. Support severity levels
  1. Once a support request is opened, a Canonical Support Engineer will validate the case information and determine the severity level, working with the customer to assess the urgency of the case.
  2. Response times will be as set forth in the Service Description for the applicable service offering.
  3. When setting the severity level, Canonical's Support Team will use the definitions as stated below:
  | | |
  |--|--|
  |**Severity Level 1**<br />Core functionality not available|Canonical will use continuous effort according to the service level purchased, through appropriate support engineer(s) and/or development engineer(s), to provide a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level.
  |**Severity Level 2**<br />Core functionality severely degraded|Canonical will provide concerted efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is no longer severely degraded, the severity level will be lowered to level 3.|
  |**Severity Level 3**<br />Standard support request|Canonical will use reasonable efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a work-around is provided, Canonical's support engineers will continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.|
  |**Severity Level 4**<br />Non-urgent request|Level 4 requests include cosmetic issues, informational requests, feature requests, and similar matters. Canonical does not provide a timeline or guarantee for inclusion of any feature requests. Canonical will review each level 4 case and determine whether it is a product enhancement to be considered for a future release, an issue to be fixed in the current release or an issue to be fixed in a future release. Canonical will review and respond to information requests with a reasonable level of effort during coverage hours. Canonical may close cases representing level 4 issues after responding if Canonical believes it is appropriate to do so.|
4. Response times. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests made by the customer within the response times set forth below, based on the applicable service and severity level.
  1. Table of response times
|                    |Standard         |Advanced|
|--------------------|-----------------|--------|
|**Severity Level 1**|4 hours, excluding weekends and holidays |1 hour  |
|**Severity Level 2**|8 business hours |2 hours |
|**Severity Level 3**|12 business hours|6 hours |
|**Severity Level 4**|24 business hours|12 hours|
  2. Resolution. Canonical will use reasonable efforts to resolve support cases, but Canonical does not guarantee a work-around, resolution or resolution time.
5. Hotfixes. To temporarily resolve critical support cases, Canonical may provide a version of the affected software (e.g. package) that applies a patch. Such versions are referred to as “hotfixes”. Hotfixes provided by Canonical are supported for 90 days after the corresponding patch has been incorporated into a release of the software in the Ubuntu Archives. However, if a patch is rejected by the applicable upstream project, the hotfix will no longer be supported and the case will remain open.
6. Languages. Canonical will provide support in English. Other languages may be available at certain times.
7. Remote sessions. Canonical may offer to access the customer’s supported system using a remote access service. In such case, Canonical will determine which remote access service to use.
8. Ubuntu Advantage Management Escalation. In the event of an unsatisfactory service of any kind, there are several ways to escalate this situation to Canonical management.
9. Feedback at end of case. When a case is closed, a survey will be emailed to the case owner concerning overall experience with Canonical’s support. All surveys are reviewed by management.
10. Ask for a Peer Review. As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback.
11. Management escalation. The customer may escalate support issues following the escalation process:
  1. Non-urgent needs. Request a management escalation within the case itself. A manager will be contacted to review the case and post a response within 1 business day.
  2. Urgent needs.
      1. Escalate to Canonical’s Support & Technical Services Manager by emailing [support-manager@canonical.com](mailto:support-manager@canonical.com).
      2. If you require further escalation, email Canonical’s Support & Technical Services Director at [operations-director@canonical.com](mailto:operations-director@canonical.com).
