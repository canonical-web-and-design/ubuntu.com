		<p>5.2: Canonical will provide a reasonable level of assistance to the customer to install Ubuntu on the customer's systems built from an officially supported computer architecture.

		<p>5.3: Canonical will support the installation, applications and system administration of Ubuntu as described in the appendices to this service description.</p>

		<p>5.4: The Ubuntu distribution is a collection of many elements of open source software. Canonical may not be able to resolve all issues, even on packages that are supported.

		<h2 id="service-description-support-requests">6. Submitting support requests</h2>

The customer may configure the support web portal to send email notifications to the customer when a case is updated.</p>

		<p>6.3: All cases are assigned a ticket number and responded to automatically. All correspondence and telephone calls are logged with a time-stamp for quality assurance.</p>

		<p>6.4: Severity Level 1 and Level 2 issues must be reported by telephone. When reporting a case the customer must specify how the issue is affecting their use of Ubuntu. The customer must provide all information requested by Canonical to resolve the case.</p>

		<p>6.5: There is no limit to the number of cases customer may submit for the customer's systems for which the services are purchased. A single support case consists of a discrete problem, issue or request although it may consist of a number of interactions with Canonical's support engineers.</p>
