    <p>In the event of an unsatisfactory service of any kind, there are several ways to escalate this situation to Canonical management.</p>

    <h3>Feedback at end of case</h3>

    <p>When a case is closed, a survey will be emailed to the case owner concerning overall experience with Canonical&#39;s support. All surveys are reviewed by management.</p>

    <h3>Ask for a Peer Review</h3>

    <p>As a normal business practice, Canonical performs peer reviews on a percentage of all cases. Customers can specifically request a peer review on a case within the case comments or by calling the phone number listed in the support portal. An impartial
      engineer will be assigned to review the case and provide feedback.</p>

    <h3>Management escalation</h3>

    <p>Non-urgent needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please request a management escalation within the case itself. A manager will be contacted to review the case and post a response within 1 business day.</li>

    <p>Urgent needs</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may escalate to Canonical&#39;s Support &amp; Technical Services Manager by emailing <a href="mailto:%73%75%70%70%6F%72%74%2D%6D%61%6E%61%67%65%72%40%63%61%6E%6F%6E%69%63%61%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">support-manager@canonical.com</a>.</li>
