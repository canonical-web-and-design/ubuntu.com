			<p>Landscape is available as a hosted service delivered via the internet, or as a dedicated server installation behind your corporate firewall. In both cases the console can be accessed in any modern web browser.</p>
			<p>The advantage of a hosted service is that you don&rsquo;t have to buy or support extra hardware. Updates and new features are delivered automatically, with no need for installation management.</p>
		</div><!-- /.six-col -->
		<div class="six-col last-col">
			<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a dedicated server running behind your firewall, Landscape can be installed on private hardware. This is functionally identical to the hosted service, but you control the hardware.</p>
			<p>Whether Landscape fits your needs better as a hosted service or dedicated server, it&rsquo;s only available with a subscription to Ubuntu Advantage.</p>
