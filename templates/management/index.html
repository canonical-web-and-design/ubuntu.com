		<h3>Benefits for system administrators</h3>
		<ul class="list-ticks--canonical">
			<li>Solves the hardest management problems, including building and maintaining software repositories, managing different machine profiles, delegating permissions at a granular level, auditing others&rsquo; actions and accessing asset information in real time.</li>
			<li>Integration with common client-side Linux sysadmin tooling, so you can see the same information about individual machines as you see in the terminal.</li>
			<li>A complete API lets you use established technologies (e.g. Bash, Python) to borrow or build on Landscape&rsquo;s functionality.</li>
			<li>Custom scripts need only be written to allow for the business logic unique to your organisation; common tasks (e.g. repository management) are already covered, so there&rsquo;s no need to re-invent the wheel.</li>
			<li>Manage machines remotely from any web browser.</li>
			<li>You can manage machines remotely from anywhere you can access a web browser.</li>
			<li>Receive alerts when updates become available for specific machines, or manage auto-update policies, instructing devices to update during set maintenance windows.</li>

		<h3>Benefits for IT managers</h3>
		<ul class="list-ticks--canonical">
			<li>Automation of repetitive tasks at scale helps ensure uniformity across your IT estate and eliminates the costs associated with rectifying human errors.</li>
			<li>By reducing the number of administrators required for basic, day-to-day management, your team are free to focus on more productive activities that deliver value to your organisation.</li>
			<li>Custom reporting makes regulatory compliance significantly less problematic, costly and time consuming.</li>
			<li>Unlike in-house systems that may have grown organically, Landscape scales with your environment, enabling you to manage up to 40,000 machines with a single instance.</li>
			<li>Thanks to an extensive, scriptable API, Landscape can be easily integrated with your current configuration management, monitoring and ticketing systems.</li>
			<li>Updates and future versions are delivered at no cost, because Landscape is part of the Ubuntu Advantage service subscription.</li>
			<li class="last-item">Landscape can be used to manage desktop, server and cloud deployments, or subsets of those deployments that you define when you subscribe to Ubuntu Advantage.</li>
