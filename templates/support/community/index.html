	 	<h3>Access free documentation</h3>
		<p>If you are stuck on a problem, someone else has probably encountered it too. Take a look at the <a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/">official documentation</a> developed and maintained by the Ubuntu Documentation Team.</p>
		
		<h3>Live support chat</h3>
		<p>If you would rather ask questions directly to the Ubuntu Community, you can <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat">access our Internet relay chat (IRC) channel</a>. Simply join the #ubuntu channel on irc.freenode.net.</p>
		<p>If you are new to Ubuntu, and have not used IRC before, you can use the application '<em>pidgin</em>' (or on some versions of Ubuntu '<em>gaim</em>') from the Applications-&gt;Internet menu on your Ubuntu desktop. Then login to irc.freenode.net and join the #ubuntu channel.</p>
		<p>If you want a more specialised channel that deals with Ubuntu derivatives, you can join <strong>#kubuntu</strong>, <strong>#edubuntu</strong>, <strong>#xubuntu</strong>.</p>
		<p>There are also dedicated channels for development, bugs, local community (LoCo) teams, accessibility and documentation.</p>
		<p>Take a look at a list of our <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InternetRelayChat">current IRC channels</a></p>
		<p>When participating in Ubuntu IRC channels, please follow the <a href="/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Web forums</h3>
		<p>If you prefer to use web forums, rather than mailing lists, especially for support-related issues, you can use or search the <a href="/support/community/web-forums">Ubuntu forums</a>. There are also <a href="/support/community/local-language">local language forums</a> available.</p>
		
		<h3>Mailing lists</h3>
		<p>Ubuntu development, support and discussions continually take place within our IRC channels and mailing lists. To join a <a href="/support/community/mailing-lists">mailing list</a> simply click on the mailing list you wish to join for further instructions.</p>
		
			<h3>Ask Ubuntu</h3>
		<p><a href="http://askubuntu.com/">http://askubuntu.com</a></p>
		<p>This is a collaboratively edited question and answer site for Ubuntu users and developers. It's 100% free, no registration required.</p>
