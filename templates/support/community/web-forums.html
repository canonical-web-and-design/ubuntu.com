		<h3>We'd like to thank our volunteer community members who run the web forums devoted to Ubuntu.</h3>
		<p>The forums are a great place to meet other Ubuntu users and developers. You can also learn about the Ubuntu community without subscribing to high-traffic mailing lists and cluttering your inbox.</p>
		<p>Please observe the same <a href="/about/about-ubuntu/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> on these forums as you would on any Ubuntu list or site.</p>
	  
		<h3>English-language forums:</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu web forums</a></p>
	  
		<h3>Other languages:</h3>
		<p>View web forums for non-English speakers available in <a href="/support/community/local-language">local languages</a>.</p>
		<p>Once again, thanks to the community members who look after these forums.</p>
