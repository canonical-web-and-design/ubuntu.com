        <h1>What is Kubeflow?</h1>
        <p>Kubeflow is an open source artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) tool that helps improve deployment, portability and management of AI/ML models. Kubeflow allows users to quickly create, train and tune neural networks within Kubernetes for dynamic resource provisioning.</p>
        <p>Kubeflow works well with TensorFlow and other modern AI/ML frameworks such as PyTorch, MXNet and Chainer allowing users to enhance their existing code and setup.</p>

      <p>For a business, the ability to define machine learning environments through code and APIs enables fast-paced automation and minimisation of MLOps costs. Kubeflow includes the ability to manage and reuse machine learning pipelines, hyper-parameter optimisations and Kubernetes serving configurations. Kubeflow’s servicing systems have been designed to be multi-framework compatible in order to allow for interoperability with TensorFlow, <a href="https://xgboost.ai/">XGBoost</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">NVIDIA TensorRT Inference Server</a>, <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>.

      <h2>Companies involved in Kubeflow</h2>
      <p>Kubeflow was originally released in March 2018 by Google as an open source initiative to develop machine learning applications using TensorFlow on top of Kubernetes to minimise MLOps effort.</p>
      <p>Today, dozens of companies contribute to Kubeflow with many more playing a part in the broader community. Canonical is focused on making it as friction-less as possible to get setup with Kubeflow and run daily operations with it.</p>

      <hr>
      <div class="p-card__description">
        <p>Hyperparameters are set before the machine learning process takes place. These parameters (e.g. topology or number of layers in a neural network) can be tuned with Katib. Katib supports various ML tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet making it easy to reuse previous experiments results with Katib and Kubeflow.</p>
