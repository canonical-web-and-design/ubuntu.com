        <h3>Private cloud and HPC architecture</h3>
      </div>
      <p>GPGPU acceleration of AI and machine learning workloads requires careful configuration of the underlying hardware and host OS. Canonical&rsquo;s Ubuntu is the leading platform for public cloud GPGPU instances and Canonical offers private cloud expertise to match.</p>
      <p>Build a GPGPU cluster and share it with multiple tenants using Canonical OpenStack - then operate Kubernetes on top for HPC and high-throughput AI / ML data science.</p>

      <h2>Kubeflow</h2>
      <p>Kubeflow helps you build composable, portable, and scalable machine learning stacks. With Kubeflow you can speed up the AI tools and framework installation process, particularly leveraging GPGPUs from Nvidia.</p>
      <p>Without Kubeflow, building production-ready machine learning stacks can involve a lot of infrastructure and devops work &mdash; mixing components and solutions, wiring them together, and managing them. This complexity can be a barrier to adopting machine learning, and it can significantly delay achieving the business benefits you are hoping to receive. And then you want to launch something production worthy; start all over again.</p>
      <p>Kubeflow solves these challenges by pulling together a handful of technologies and components that let you get a stack up and running quickly. You can accelerate that roadmap and benefit from community and/or corporate support.</p>

      <p>TensorFlow  is an open source software library for high-performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Googleâ€™s AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used across many other scientific domains.</p>
      <p>TensorFlow comes with visualisation technology &mdash; TensorBoard. It features graphs, histograms and helps with visualising learning.</p>

      <h2>Operations automation</h2>
      <p>The real challenge of Kubeflow is everyday operations automation, year after year, while Kubeflow continues to evolve rapidly. This includes the everyday automation of the stack under Kubeflow. Canonical solves this problem with model-driven operations that decouple your architectural choices from the operations codebase that supports upgrades, scaling, integration and security.</p>
      <h3>Total automation of gpgpu enabled infrastructure</h3>
      <p>Eliminate the extra steps needed to take advantage of your gpgpu&rsquo;s by leveraging Kubeflow. With drivers tailored to your chipset, you&rsquo;ll get the most out of your investment, and speed up your deep learning initiatives.</p>

      <h2>Artificial Intelligence infrastructure architecture</h2>
      <p class="u-sv3">To get the most out of Kubeflow, you&rsquo;ll want to run it on an effective supporting stack. Minimally, leveraging the Charmed Distribution of Kubernetes (CDK) gives you the benefits of perfect portability between your private data-center and the public cloud.  CDK on Canonical Openstack unlocks further benefits, as described below.</p>

        <h3>Compute</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Every ounce of performance matters. If you&rsquo;re building a private cloud you want the maximum performance for your workloads, the maximum utilisation in your data center, and the maximum economic efficiency. Canonical delivers all three.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-card col-6">
      <div class="p-card__header">
        <h3>Storage</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Storage performance and economics are tricky to balance in a cloud environment. Canonical will help you architect your storage across the cluster to balance price and performance, ensuring the right mix of resilience, latency, iops and integrity for your particular deployment.</p>

        <h3>Networking</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Network performance is critical for speeding up large deep learning exercises. The major factor in perceived cloud performance is aggregate network throughput and latency across the underlying cluster. Canonical&rsquo;s work with hyperscale public clouds ensures that we have deep insight into the dynamics of cloud network performance and security best practices for large-scale multi-tenanted operations. Our work with telco groups for NFV and edge clouds ensures that we can work well in complex environments where latency and security are critical.</p>

        <h3>Operational Dashboards</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Operations in highly coherent large-scale distributed clusters require a new level of operational monitoring and observability. Canonical delivers a standardised set of open source log aggregation and systems monitoring dashboards with every cloud, using Prometheus, the Elastic Search and Kibana stack (ELK), and Nagios.</p>
