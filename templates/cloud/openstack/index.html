		<h2><span class="step">1</span> Start with Ubuntu Server</h2>
		<p>The first step in building a cloud with Ubuntu OpenStack is to download the latest LTS version of Ubuntu Server. LTS stands for long-term support and guarantees security and maintenance updates from Canonical for five years. It also includes all the latest kernel features, support for the latest hardware and the most up-to-date packages.</p>
		<p>Once you have downloaded Ubuntu Server, you are ready to use MAAS to provision the hardware that will become your cloud.</p>

		<h2><span class="step">2</span> Provision your machines with MAAS</h2>
		<p>Free with Ubuntu Server, MAAS (Metal-as-a-Service) transforms your machines into a cloud in minutes. No need to worry about arduous, time consuming configuration and provisioning. MAAS automates it all, eliminating the risk of human error – and it works with almost all conventional hardware.</p>

		<h2><span class="step">3</span> Configure OpenStack </h2>
		<p>Once your hardware has been provisioned with the base Ubuntu OS, you can use Juju to deploy the latest version of OpenStack. The release schedules for Ubuntu and OpenStack are synchronised, so you always have access to the latest versions of both: currently Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and OpenStack Icehouse. The Ubuntu Cloud Archive provides links to current and older OpenStack releases, tested for compatibility with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. </p>

		<p>Once OpenStack is up and running, Juju can then be used to spin up practically any cloud service you need in just a few minutes &dash; either from your browser or the command line, whichever you prefer. You can even use it to deploy bundles of commonly-combined services in a single action. Nothing gets vital cloud services up and running faster. </p>

		<h2><span class="step">5</span> Manage your cloud with Ubuntu Advantage</h2>
		<p>The final stage before you go into production is to ensure you have adequate management and support in place. Canonical provides the ultimate cloud management package in the form of Ubuntu Advantage &dash; a subscription service that includes Landscape, the cloud admin system that makes managing thousands of nodes as easy as one. This is backed up with direct access to Canonical&rsquo;s cloud engineers and hands-on training for your cloud admin team.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re considering a pilot of Ubuntu OpenStack, Canonical can help you plan and execute it, on your premises or in your data centre.</p>
		<p>With Jumpstart Training, a Canonical engineer will deliver a preconfigured micro-cluster of servers to your office and provide two full days of technical training, covering Ubuntu, MAAS, Juju, Landscape, and OpenStack. They leave the micro-cluster with you for two weeks allowing your team time to:</p>
		<ul class="list-canonical">
			<li>Prototype your OpenStack experience in a private sandbox environment</li>
			<li>Experiment with various storage alternatives, practice scaling services, and destroy and rebuild the environment repeatedly</li>
