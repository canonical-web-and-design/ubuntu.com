		<h2>OpenStack loves Ubuntu</h2>
		<p>The reference architecture for OpenStack is based on Ubuntu. Jumpstart gives you a private cloud compatible with that architecture, on the hardware of your choice. The resulting cloud will be adapted to your preference for storage, network and compute &mdash; and will remain compatible with our reference cloud for all workloads.</p>

		<h4>Canonical helps your <br/>cloud grow</h4>
		<p>Ubuntu is the OS of choice for new clouds, both as host and guest. Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, has unparalleled experience deploying cloud infrastructure solutions; we can help you take the core design decisions needed to ensure your cloud will grow smoothly in years to come.</p>

		<h4>Planning for the hybrid cloud</h4>
		<p>Ubuntu offers native support for all major private and public cloud platforms. It&rsquo;s the most heavily used OS on both Amazon AWS and Rackspace, and hosts new public clouds from multiple industry players. Building your private cloud with Ubuntu cloud Infrastructure gives you the unmatched ability to burst workloads from your private cloud to the major public clouds.</p>
