		<h2>What is LXD (&ldquo;lex-dee&rdquo;)?</h2>
		<p>Imagine you could launch a new machine in under a second, and that you could launch hundreds of them on a single server. Hundreds! Now, imagine that you have hardware-guaranteed security to ensure that those machines can&rsquo;t pry or spy on one another. Imagine you can connect them separately and securely to networks. And imagine that you can run that on a single node or a million, live migrate machines between those nodes, and talk to all of it through a clean, extensible REST API.</p>
		<p>By combining the speed and density of containers with the security of traditional virtual machines, LXD is the next-generation of container hypervisor for Linux from Canonical.</p>

		<h2>Building on LXC (&ldquo;lex-cee&rdquo;)?</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu is by far the most popular platform for container engineering, including Docker and LXC. We&rsquo;re passionate about enabling that innovation to go further and faster.</p>

    <p>Developers love LXC because it gives them an near instant, full system container where they can run a wide range of Linux operating environments.</p>

    <p>Developers can run LXD on all the machines where they want to create and tear down these environments, and use LXC to drive the process from anywhere on the network.</p>

	<h2>Is LXD a real Linux hypervisor?</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>We&rsquo;re working with silicon companies to ensure hardware-assisted security and isolation for these containers, just like virtual machines today. We&rsquo;ll ensure that the kernel security cross-section for individual containers can be tightened up for each specific workload. We will make sure you can live-migrate these containers from machine to machine. And we&rsquo;re adding the ability to bind storage and network interfaces to the containers, just like virtual machines.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="six-col last-col">
		<p>All of this work is aimed at giving you the full experience of virtual machines, the full security of a hypervisor, but much, much faster. Without all that virtualization overhead, you get the full underlying performance of your host environment. On bare metal, these containers are just as fast as the native OS on bare metal. In the cloud, you are getting subdivided machines without getting sub-par performance.</p>

		<h2>And Docker?</h2>
		<p>Docker is an amazing application delivery mechanism, which may change the world of devops forever.</p>

    <p>There are seven times more Docker containers running on Ubuntu than any other OS. For the most efficient way to deliver your binaries to a platform for execution, Docker is the dance for us.</p>

    <p>LXD and Docker share some underlying kernel capabilities, we aim to bring much of the awesome security and isolation of LXD to Docker as well.</p>

		<h2>Integration with OpenStack</h2>
		<p>The combination of LXD and OpenStack makes for a very happy system administrator in a Linux-oriented private cloud. All the agility of OpenStack, all the performance of your metal with no virt overhead.</p>
		<p>As a validation point, we&rsquo;ve included the nova-compute-lxd driver in Ubuntu {{latest_release}}, and are committed to steering this into upstream OpenStack. </p>
		<p>This new driver allows OpenStack instances to be scheduled as Linux Containers. Images are booted from OpenStack&rsquo;s image service, Glance, and instances communicate over Neutron&rsquo;s networking functionality just like KVM based VMs do.</p>

		<h2>Getting started with LXD</h2>
		<p>Our OpenStack container capability, codenamed nova-compute-lxd  is included in Ubuntu {{latest_release}}. Simply type the following commands to enable and use it:</p>
		<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nova-compute-lxd</code></pre>
		<p>OpenStack Juno is available for Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS and 14.10.</p>
