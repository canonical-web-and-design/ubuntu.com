    <h2>The challenge</h2>
  <div class="seven-col">
    <p>The pace of data creation is exploding. As structured and unstructured data fills disks and data retention policies lengthen, every organisation must find cost-effective ways to grow their storage infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Traditionally enterprise storage needs have been met with appliance-like <abbr title="Storage Area Network">SAN</abbr> (Storage Area Network) and <abbr title="Network Attached Storage">NAS</abbr> (Network Attached Storage) solutions. However, they are often expensive to purchase, expand and upgrade.</p>
    <p>Designed from the ground up for petabyte-scale deployments, Ubuntu Advantage Storage now offers a proven Software-defined storage (<abbr title="Software-defined storage">SDS</abbr>) alternative at the lowest per gigabyte price.</p>

    <p>Legacy storage solutions are often priced per-node or according to total disk capacity. This can lead to a penalty for good practices such as high durability&nbsp;replication.</p>
    <p>Ubuntu Advantage Storage is different. Our pricing is based on the amount of data you record in your storage pool, regardless of how it is written or how much disk space is used.</p>
    <p>Ubuntu Advantage Storage &mdash; because you shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for replicas, and you shouldn't have to pay for empty space.</p>
