		<h1>Ecosystem</h1>
		<p class="intro">Ubuntu: the centre of the cloud ecosystem</p>
		<p>Wherever you look in the cloud, you&rsquo;ll see Ubuntu. It&rsquo;s integral to public clouds, Platform as a Service,  OpenStack and much more, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that the community, developers and <abbr  title="Independent Software Vendor">ISV</abbr>s all default to Ubuntu. To help you navigate the cloud ecosystem, Canonical has partnered with the very best software and solutions companies.</p>

		<h2>Ubuntu and OpenStack</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu has been involved in OpenStack since the beginning, and it&rsquo;s the most popular choice for production OpenStack clouds around the world. Since OpenStack became part of Ubuntu in October 2010, the two have evolved into a fully manageable and supportable OpenStack platform. To deploy, manage and scale Ubuntu OpenStack, we have a set of tools:</p>
		<ul class="list-ubuntu">
			<li>MAAS &mdash; bare-metal provisioning, quickly turns your hardware environment into a cloud</li>
			<li>Juju &mdash; service orchestration, the fastest way to deploy OpenStack on Ubuntu</li>
			<li>Landscape &mdash; systems management, for sophisticated security, audit and compliance control</li>

		<h2>Ubuntu OpenStack interoperability lab</h2>
		<p>The Ubuntu Openstack ecosystem is growing fast.  But as the options grow so does the task of ensuring interoperability between all the components. At Canonical we developed a sophisticated test and integration process to ensure we could offer each release of OpenStack integrated with Ubuntu Server.  We&rsquo;ve now opened it into a lab dedicated to integrating components and testing their interoperability.</p>
