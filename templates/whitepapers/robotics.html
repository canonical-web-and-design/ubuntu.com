      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        Robots have been the subject of science fiction films for decades, but with
        technological advances, including the rise of internet connected devices, a real
        robotic revolution is beginning to emerge. Converging with the growth of
        artificial intelligence and machine learning, robots are being adopted in every
        sector imaginable, including consumer, industrial, healthcare, and retail.
        According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42880417">IDC</a>, worldwide robotic spending, encompassing hardware,
        software and related services, is set to reach US$230.7bn by 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--accent">
        Due to the sizeable market potential, demand, and evolution of
        technology, companies are seizing the opportunity to build
        robots. However as with many other initiatives in the wider
        Internet of Things (IoT) industry, there are key decisions that
        robotic manufacturers need to make from the development stage
        onwards to ensure they are building a sustainable, future-proof,
        and secure robot.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        One of the most important decisions to be made is that of the
        robot’s operating system. Unfortunately, this importance is not
        always obvious until the company is too invested to change it,
        which can lead to a slew of delays or issues to overcome. The
        operating system that’s perfect for hacking things together may
        be impossible to maintain once the robot reaches production.
        Similarly, the build-your-own option means maintaining the entire
        operating system (backporting upstream security updates, etc.)
        for the lifetime of the robot. The rock-solid, stable option may
        end up having versions of dependencies that are too old to use.
        That snazzy new one created by a niche startup that seems to tick
        all the boxes is less appealing if they suddenly go out of business.

      <h2>Development factors</h2>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        The initial development of the robot is a critical time when it comes to
        technology selection, both hardware and software. Unless a company is in the
        habit of burning money, the operating system used on the robot during this
        stage should also be the one used in production (or at least closely related).
        There’s a balancing act to be had here: the engineering team will naturally want
        the operating system that best supports whatever they’re developing, but
        there are more factors to be considered.

            Ubuntu is an open source operating system for the desktop, cloud, and IoT
            devices, including robots. Ubuntu is the leading cloud guest OS, running most
            public cloud workloads today on Azure, AWS, Google and IBM. According to
            RightScale’s latest <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud">State of the Cloud</a> report, the majority of the cloud market
            (64%) runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Of all cloud instances on AWS,
            <a href="https://thecloudmarket.com/stats">56% are Ubuntu</a>. In addition, 40% of Linux users run Ubuntu or Ubuntu Core
            on their IoT solution according to <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/kartben/iot-developer-survey-2018">Eclipse’s 2018 Developer Survey</a>.

      <p class="u-text--muted">
        Regardless of other reasons used when deciding on a given operating system,
        selecting one that isn’t compatible with the technology required (libraries,
        frameworks, etc.) is a recipe for disaster. The engineering team will spin its
        wheels while competitors hit the market first. Perhaps required libraries are
        written specifically for certain Linux distributions, or the team has settled on
        using some middleware to enable faster development. For example, 49% of the
        roboticists we polled were using the <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a> (ROS). If
        potential operating systems are evaluated with this in mind, it will help lead to
        a very streamlined development process.

        Hardware compatibility should also be a primary concern, for much the same
        reason as software: a significant chunk of time will be spent ensuring
        components to work together before any real progress can be made on the
        robot itself. For example, it’s not unusual to find hardware that requires drivers
        only written for specific Linux distributions, or to work with vendors that have
        limited exposure to Linux in general.

      <p class="u-text--muted">
        Speed is a big deal when developing any product; market leaders can easily be
        determined simply by who gets there first. When a team is considering
        programming language options for a new project, the decision is heavily
        influenced by the team’s familiarity with said language. This isn’t necessarily
        because the team is resistant to change, but because they know they can produce
        higher-quality work in less time if they can use a familiar language. A similar
        consideration must be made when looking at operating systems: if the
        engineering team isn’t already familiar with it, time to market will be delayed as
        they learn its ins and outs.

      <h3>Ease of system integration</h3>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        A robot is rarely a standalone device: it often needs to seamlessly interact with
        other devices. The other device may be as simple as a digital twin for hardware-
        in-the-loop testing, but in general, off-device computation is getting more
        popular in robotics. Cloud robotics, speech processing, and machine learning
        are all use-cases that can benefit from processing information in a server farm
        instead of on a resource-constrained robot. If possible, it makes a lot of sense
        to use the same operating system on the robot as in the cloud. It prevents
        division of domain knowledge, and keeps processes the same, decreasing
        development time of both the client and server components.

      <p class="u-text--muted">
        One of the many joys of engineering is problem-solving. However, every
        engineer gets to the point where they need some help. Where do they turn? Of
        course, it depends on the problem. If they need help with the operating
        system, they often turn to the community around that distribution, where
        more often than not, others are experiencing the same issues. For example,
        Ubuntu has community support through its <a href="https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/">security notices</a>, <a href="https://askubuntu.com">AskUbuntu</a>, the
        <a href="https://ubuntuforums.org">Ubuntu forums</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu">Launchpad</a>, as well as various <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList">IRC channels</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com">mailing lists</a>.

        On the other hand, what if the issues have nothing to do with the operating
        system at all? The operating system can still be an important part of obtaining
        support. For example, ROS only hosts package repositories for Debian and
        Ubuntu, which means that the use of those operating systems are essentially
        assumed whenever one asks for help.

      <h2>Production factors</h2>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        Once a robot starts the move from development to production and maintenance,
        new factors come into play. If this part of the picture wasn’t taken into account
        prior to reaching this stage, there will be pain as the company either just ships
        what they already have, or scramble to engineer solutions to problems that could
        have already been solved. This is likely to result in a delayed entry into the market,
        lost profits, higher support costs, and probably its own set of technical problems.
      </p>
      <h3>Software update process</h3>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        It doesn’t take long to find examples of companies who started shipping
        devices without considering the need to update them. The Internet of Things
        market is flooded with them. With the rush to get devices to market, it’s not at
        all rare to find devices with hard-coded credentials, development keys, various
        security vulnerabilities, and no update path.
      </p>
    </div>

<section class="p-strip">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-10">
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        The Mirai botnet is an excellent example of this. It infected so many devices
        that it amassed the bandwidth to take internet giants like Twitter, Paypal, and
        Spotify offline back in 2016. How did it infect these devices? By using default,
        hard-coded credentials. Did the companies who created them react quickly and
        release updates to all those devices in order to secure them? No, in the absence
        of an update plan, they were forced to recall them. The cost of figuring out a
        good update story up front pales in comparison to that of a mass recall.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        There’s also the less dramatic example of customers hitting a bug, or the
        company wanting to enable a new feature. Being able to do this quickly and
        cheaply without causing customer frustration is paramount. There are a few
        ways to achieve this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p class="u-text--accent">
          First of all, if the number of customers is small, it is feasible to use a field engineer,
          traveling to customers and updating them. This provides the utmost control, but it
          doesn’t scale well, and quickly becomes astronomically expensive as either the number
          of updates or the number of customers rise.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="u-text--accent">
          A second, more common method is firmware downloads: bundling all updates into a
          single downloadable image which is then flashed to the device. This scales better with
          the number of updates or customers, but it requires the engineering of infrastructure
          to host the update, as well as software to robustly apply it. Also, what happens if the
          update bricks the robot? A recovery plan also needs to be developed. All of these things
          take time and money.
        </p></li>
        <li><p class="u-text--accent">
          The optimum solution is to select an operating system that has this functionality built
          into it, like those that support <a href="https://snapcraft.io">Snapcraft</a>. A company using Snaps for their software
          immediately solves all these problems at once: they’re fast and easy, use infrastructure
          that already exists (the Snap Store), update automatically when an update is released,
          and have rollback/disaster recovery built in. Ideally, though, these advantages would
          cover the entire operating system, not just the software the company puts on top.
          There’s only one operating system that uses Snaps for everything, including the inner-
          workings of the operating system itself: <a href="/core">Ubuntu Core</a>.

      <h3>Long-term support</h3>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
        In addition to considering how operating system updates are delivered, one must
        consider for how long those updates will be delivered. Specific versions of
        operating systems are typically only supported for a set amount of time. For
        example, long-term support releases of Android Things are <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/say-hello-to-android-things-10.html">supported for three
        years</a>, whereas Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core are <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">supported for five years</a> (or even
        longer with <a href="/support/esm">Extended Security Maintenance</a>). If the supported lifespan of the
        operating system is shorter than the anticipated lifespan of the robot being
        produced, it will eventually stop getting updates, potentially falling prey to the
        Mirai botnets of tomorrow. At the very least, it will force the company to devise a
        new plan for security updates incurring additional expense and time that wasn’t
        accounted for during development.

      <h3>Ensuring a profitable lifespan</h3>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
          Actually shipping and maintaining robots might be the final story for some, but
          it shouldn’t be, and it certainly isn’t the strategy necessary to retain customers
          and extend the robot’s lifespan. How does it stay relevant as competitors come
          out with newer products?
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
          The iPhone serves as a good example, here. The first iPhone, released in 2007,
          ran iPhone OS 1, which did not support third-party applications. How long
          would it have stayed relevant if they continued down that path? After the
          newness wore off, a vast number of users would likely have jumped to
          something else. However, it wasn’t long before iPhone OS 2 came out, which
          included the app store. The rest is history.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
          This isn’t something that will apply to all robotic platforms, but it’s something
          that should be considered. Depending on the purpose of the robot, one could
          actually open it up completely, allowing control or sensor use via APIs, and then
          support a third-party app store of some kind (such as the <a href="https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps/">Snap Store</a>). This can
          increase the longevity of the robot by essentially allowing third parties to have
          another vision for it, but this depends on the robot being pretty general-
          purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
          Even if the robot isn’t general-purpose (they rarely are), an app store can open
          up alternative revenue streams, where new functionality can be provided in
          exchange for a fee, or on a subscription basis. If a company adopts a private
          store (e.g. a IoT app <a href="/internet-of-things/appstore">store</a>), it could open it up to select partners as well,
          opening the door to collaboration and mutual benefit.

        Take Rigado, for example. They create edge
        gateways for large-scale commercial IoT
        deployments. Every customer has slightly different
        requirements, so these gateways can actually be
        customised using a curated list of applications in
        their app store. Not only does this allow the device
        to be used in different industries, but Rigado is
        planning to extend this capability to allow business
        partners to provide further-customised app stores
        to their customers.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="u-text--muted">
          The field of robotics is moving in the same direction as other devices that make
          up the IoT: smarter and always connected. The importance of the operating
          system running on a platform like this cannot be understated. Throughout the
          entire lifecycle of the robot, it can be there to either help or hinder. Which one
          depends on whether or not the company considers the entire picture before
          making a decision.
