      <h2>Common questions</h2>
      <h5>Do all levels of Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure have access to Ubuntu ESM?</h5>
      <p>Yes. Ubuntu ESM is available for UA-I Essential, Standard and Advanced customers. For more information on levels please visit our <a href="/pricing">pricing page</a>. Existing UA customers can request their credentials through the <a href="https://support.canonical.com/ua/s/article/obtain-ESM-credentials-and-modify-your-apt-sources-to-get-ESM-updates">Canonical support portal</a>.</p>
      <h5>How can we ensure the security of our Ubuntu systems after the end of Standard Security Maintenance?</h5>
      <p>Sign up to Ubuntu Advantage now, and you will benefit from UA services immediately without having a gap in service when a particular release reaches the end of its Standard Security Maintenance window. For more details of initial release dates and maintenance cadence, see <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases">wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases</a>. Ubuntu Advantage is available at <a href="https://buy.ubuntu.com">buy.ubuntu.com</a> and through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01MZ1LSBQ?qid=1486382973569&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title">AWS Marketplace</a>.</p>
      <h5>How long will Ubuntu ESM be maintained?</h5>
      <p>This depends on the release. Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) and 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) will have updates provided for up to three years after the end of the Standard Security Maintenance window. Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) and subsequent releases until further announcement will have ESM updates provided for up to five years.</p>
      <h5>Is it possible to purchase Ubuntu ESM months down the road when needed, with or without backdating the cost, or does it need to be in place in advance?</h5>
      <p>You can purchase Ubuntu Advantage support at any time. It does not need to be in place in advance, although we strongly recommend you eliminate the gap between when Ubuntu ESM is enabled on your system(s), to avoid exposing your systems to security vulnerabilities. Ubuntu Advantage is priced year-over-year so there is no backdating.</p>
      <h5>We’re mirroring the repository on our internal Landscape server. Can we still get Ubuntu ESM if using Landscape?</h5>
      <p>ESM is just a regular Ubuntu archive, but authenticated and served over HTTPS. Archive mirroring is already available in Landscape and is a supported mechanism for mirroring the ESM archive.</p>
      <h5>Will source code for Ubuntu ESM patches be made available? If so, will that be publicly available on Launchpad or only through Ubuntu ESM?</h5>
      <p>Both the binary updates and source code will be available to Ubuntu ESM users. We honour all licenses associated with the open-source code in Ubuntu.</p>
