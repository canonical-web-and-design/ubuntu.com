{% block meta_description %}Ubuntu brings a stunning, natural new user interface to the mobile phone that's designed to immerse you in your content and applications and improve your flow between them. Edge magic - thumb gestures from all four edges of the screen - deliver a much faster way of finding content and switching between apps. Ubuntu allows the user to focus on their content, rather than on-screen application controls. And the Ubuntu phone fits perfectly into the wider family of Ubuntu interfaces, alongside the PC and TV. It's a uniquely, beautifully converged experience.{% endblock %}

		<h1>A phone you can see yourself in</h1> 
		<p>Ubuntu reflects you in the personalised graphics adorning the phone&rsquo;s welcome screen. Designed by artists who specialise in creating beautiful visualisations of complex data, the welcome screen evolves as you use the phone, to be perfectly unique and personal. This isn&rsquo;t so much a lock screen, it&rsquo;s a sign saying: &ldquo;come in&rdquo;. A signature flourish for Ubuntu and for you.</p>

Ubuntu searches on your phone and at online retailers including Amazon and the Ubuntu One Music Store, so you can fill those gaps in your music collection.</p>
		<p>Best of all, Ubuntu gets to know you over time, so the results will grow more relevant the more you search. Wherever it is, let Dash find it for you.</p>

		<h2>A whole world of apps</h2>
		<p>Web applications sit alongside native apps on Ubuntu. They get their own icons and the same access to system notifications. So apps like Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, The Weather Channel and Dropbox are all available from day one &mdash; and thanks to our web app APIs, it&rsquo;s easy for web developers to make their sites install on the phone.</p>
		<p>But Ubuntu isn&rsquo;t limited to HTML5. Native apps are blazingly fast, taking advantage of the full capabilities of the phone&rsquo;s processor and graphics hardware. And a mobile SDK does most of the work for you, giving you an Ubuntu look and feel.</p>
