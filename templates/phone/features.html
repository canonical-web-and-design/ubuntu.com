		<h1>A phone you can see yourself in</h1>
		<p>Ubuntu reflects you in the personalised graphics adorning the phone&rsquo;s welcome screen. Designed by artists who specialise in finding beautiful visualisations of complex data, the welcome screen evolves as you use the phone, to be perfectly unique and personal. This isn’t so much a lock screen, it&rsquo;s a sign saying: &ldquo;come in&rdquo;. A signature flourish for Ubuntu and for you.</p>

		<h2>A whole world of apps</h2>
		<p>Web applications sit alongside native apps on Ubuntu. They get their own icons and the same access to system notifications. So apps like Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, The Weather Channel and Dropbox are all available from day one &mdash; and thanks to our web app APIs, it&rsquo;s easy for web developers to make their sites install on the phone.</p>
		<p>But Ubuntu isn&rsquo;t limited to HTML5. Native apps are blazingly fast, taking advantage of the full capabilities of the phone’s processor and graphics hardware. And a mobile SDK does most of the work for you, giving you an Ubuntu look and feel.</p>
