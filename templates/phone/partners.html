		<h2>Differentiate where it matters</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu allows you to control the entire service layer &mdash; the visual identity and the suite of digital life services &mdash; ensuring a consistent user experience. This gives you the opportunity to differentiate your handsets without fragmenting or forking the operating system. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to increase revenue that simply doesn&rsquo;t exist on other&nbsp;platforms.</p>

		<h2>Profit via user payments</h2>
		<p>As well as integrating your content, functionality and branding, you can take over the management of your users&rsquo; financial interactions. You can integrate your own payment systems deep into the phone, via Ubuntu&rsquo;s unique frameworks. And while you can opt to use the default Ubuntu store for downloads and purchases, you can also customise it to showcase your services, or replace it with your own store. No other mobile platform makes it this easy to develop your own ecosystem and revenue streams.</p>

		<h2>Targeting mid to high end&nbsp;devices</h2>
		<p>With a user experience and partner differentiation strategy that revolves around content and services &mdash; Ubuntu is tailored for users that require higher data usage and higher quality devices. By targeting mid to high end devices with Ubuntu, carriers and device manufacturers can deliver a superior experience while leveraging Ubuntu&rsquo;s service layer differentiation opportunities.</p>
