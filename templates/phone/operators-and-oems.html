		<h1>Built for the phone industry</h1>
		<p>Ubuntu comes to phones with the specific needs of network operators, OEMs and ODMs in mind. It offers great performance on handsets with a low bill of materials, while opening up new opportunities for phone and PC convergence at the top end of the market. And there are many ways in which the user experience can be tailored to your brand.</p>

		<h2>We&rsquo;re open to everyone</h2>
		<p>Ubuntu is an open source operating system, which means our code is shared openly throughout the development cycle.  We are transparent about our plans for future releases, so as a developer, carrier or manufacturer you can start building apps and phone designs for Ubuntu immediately.</p>

	<h2>Customise to your needs</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>We&rsquo;ve built Ubuntu to embrace operator and OEM content, services and branding from the beginning, in a way that leaves the all-important Ubuntu design and app ecosystem largely untouched. Canonical engages with OEMs and operators to enable them to ship phones with true service-layer differentiation that consumers will appreciate.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="six-col last-col">
		<p>Content can be surfaced in the home screen and search scopes, featured apps can be pre-installed and the UI has been designed with room for effective co-branding. Many of the core applications will accept back-end services coming through their front-end, so content can be surfaced without ever overwhelming the user.</p>

	<h2>Stunning design on any smartphone</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>Ubuntu provides a fast and beautiful experience on inexpensive hardware. It doesn&rsquo;t have the overhead of a Java virtual machine, so all core applications run at full native speeds with a small memory footprint.</p>
		<p>Our traditional consumer users can enjoy a blisteringly fast experience on their mid-range phones. Smart search scopes and intelligent filtering makes it easy to access a huge range of content.</p>

		<p>And at the high end, Ubuntu paves the way  for a new category of superphones, with a full PC desktop accessible just by docking the device to a monitor and keyboard. A handheld PC is the future of personal computing &mdash; true convergence.</p>

	<h2>Easier hardware enablement</h2>
	<div class="seven-col">
		<p>We have teams based in Taipei, Shanghai, London, Beijing and Boston to engage with your engineering and factory operations - and their sole focus is to deliver a crisp Ubuntu experience on your device.</p>
		<p>Ubuntu has already been adapted to run on chipsets using ARM and Intel x86 architectures, with the core system based around a typical Android Board Support Package (BSP). So chipset vendors and hardware manufacturers don&rsquo;t need to invest in or maintain new hardware support packages. In short, if you already make handsets that run Android, the work needed to adopt Ubuntu for smartphones will be trivial.</p>

	<h2>The phone with the heart of a PC</h2>
	<div class="six-col">
		<p>High-end smartphones have a brain as powerful as a full PC. Ubuntu, with its next-generation Mir graphics architecture, uniquely enables a new kind of convergence device: a phone that docks to become a full PC and thin client. Enterprise IT departments will soon be able to replace phones, thin clients and laptops with a single corporate device.</p>
		<p>With support for remote Windows apps over Microsoft RDP, Citrix or VMWare, the Ubuntu superphone is a complete enterprise solution &mdash; and a new opportunity for operators to deliver enterprise IT to SMEs in LTE markets. And because it enjoys the full capabilities of Ubuntu &mdash; including kernel-level control of every app &mdash; it puts the security and manageability of UNIX in your pocket.</p>
